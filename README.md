# covid-19-reporter for Telegram Bot
Personal project for telegram bot 

Link to telegram bot: https://t.me/covid_reporter_bot

Scrape the data of corona virus from worldometer and sequentially updates the user at regular time interval. 

I developed this application bot after trying out different platforms that provide the information and found them to be troublesome. I wanted something automated and inform me daily and whenever I need it on specific country that I am interested in.
